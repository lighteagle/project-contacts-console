# Project Contacts Console

Contacts is a simple application to store and manage people's contacts. Just like an address book in your phone or email.

A complete Contacts app should able to:

- Save or store contacts
- Each contact can contains people's name, phone, email, birth date, address, etc.
- Show all contacts
- Filter contacts based on name's length
- Add new contact
- Remove specific contact
- Update contact's name, phone, email, etc

---

- Use multiple variables to contain variety of data types (string, number, boolean, array, object).
- Use multiple functions to process your contacts application
